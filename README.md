In February 2018 **Dan Wainwright** illustrated a [story by **Sam Francis** about vulnerable people being unable to access social housing due to a change in the law](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42919703).

We compared the numbers of people on local authority waiting lists in 2010 with those in 2017 and showed the areas with the biggest rises and falls.
